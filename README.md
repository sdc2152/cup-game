## How to play
The object of the game is to fill the rotating cups with as many balls as you can. If a ball misses a cup it is gone for good. When a players ball count drops below 10 the game is over.

###Controls
the controls are pretty simple, just hold down the spacebar to release balls from the main container.

### Bonus Features (To do)
- Make some cups worth more points
- Add a high score system
- Add a penalty that subtracts points over time
